Dashboards don't create value. Decisions do.

I've seen teams spend months building beautiful, interactive visualizations that nobody uses. The charts are perfect, the filters are responsive, the design is polished — and the stakeholder still calls their analyst to ask "so what does this mean?"

The problem isn't the dashboard. The problem is that nobody started with the decision.

## Start with the question

A useful analytics product starts with a question someone is actually responsible for answering:

- What should we fund next?
- Where is risk accumulating?
- What's changing faster than our process can handle?
- Are we meeting our compliance obligations?

Then you build backwards: **data → logic → visualization → adoption**.

Every design decision should trace back to that question. If a chart doesn't help someone answer it, the chart doesn't belong on the dashboard.

## The adoption gap

Here's the uncomfortable truth about most analytics projects: the technical work is the easy part. Getting people to change their behavior — to actually use the dashboard instead of their spreadsheet — is much harder.

Adoption requires:

- **Trust in the data.** If a stakeholder finds one number that doesn't match their mental model, they'll distrust the entire platform. You need to be transparent about data quality, freshness, and known limitations.
- **Fit with existing workflows.** People don't reorganize their workday around a dashboard. The dashboard needs to fit into how they already make decisions.
- **Training that meets people where they are.** A VP and a junior analyst need different things from the same tool. Design (and teach) accordingly.
- **Ongoing maintenance.** A dashboard that was accurate six months ago but hasn't been updated is worse than no dashboard at all.

## Analytics as a system

The best analytics work I've done hasn't been about building a single great dashboard. It's been about building a **system** — a pipeline of data, logic, visualization, governance, and adoption that produces reliable, trustworthy outputs over time.

That means:
- Data pipelines with monitoring and alerting
- Metric definitions that stakeholders agree on
- Documentation that survives team turnover
- Training and enablement that runs alongside delivery

It's less glamorous than a beautiful chart. But it's what actually drives decisions.
