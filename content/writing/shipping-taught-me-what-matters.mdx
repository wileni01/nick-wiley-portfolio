This post is about shipping, because shipping a real product taught me lessons that theory did not.

I built something. It exists. I am proud of it. It also cost more than I expected and took longer than I expected. If I could go back, I would ship a smaller product in one month at one tenth the cost, then iterate with real users.

That sentence still makes me pause, because it is an honest correction.

I used to think the hard part was building the thing. The hard part was everything around the thing.

Release processes are real.

Platform restrictions are real.

User expectations are real.

Team coordination is real.

Legal and business constraints are real.

I learned how demanding app store release can be. I learned that requirements can be vague and still enforced strictly. I learned that what feels like a small technical change can create a cascade across testing, documentation, and compliance.

I also learned that teams can multiply throughput or quietly limit it. Unclear ownership creates drag. Misaligned incentives create slow failure. Trust and clarity often matter more than heroics.

Along the way I learned a lot of adjacent craft. Unity development. Asset management. Integration details that make a system feel stable or fragile. I learned how important partnerships can be and how much you eventually depend on other teams and companies.

I even collided with domains I did not expect to touch, like patent law and business law. Builders eventually hit the boundary between code and the world, and the world does not care that you just wanted to ship.

Where does agentic engineering fit into this.

If I had these tools earlier, I think I would have moved faster on certain parts. I could have generated scaffolding quicker. I could have explored alternatives faster. I could have drafted tests and documentation more efficiently. That would have helped.

But it would not have replaced judgment. It would not have replaced user feedback. It would not have replaced scope discipline.

In fact, I can imagine a version of myself using agent speed as an excuse to overbuild even more. Speed is only a benefit when it is paired with a tight loop to reality.

The main lesson I carry forward is that small releases beat big dreams, at least early.

A small release is honest. It forces contact with real constraints. It produces data. It creates a baseline that you can improve. A big launch without feedback can feel motivating, but it is easy to spend months building confidence instead of building evidence.

So when I talk about being a builder, this is what I mean. I want to ship thin slices, learn quickly, and keep quality high as the surface area grows.

If you have shipped something and learned a lesson the hard way, I would like to hear it. Especially the lesson that changed how you scope and how you validate.
