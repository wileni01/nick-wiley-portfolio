## Why this mattered

Building tools is only half the job. Understanding whether people actually use them, and how, is what separates successful delivery from shelfware. Across the suite of analytics and decision-support tools I built, there was no systematic way to measure adoption, spot underused features, or detect workflow bottlenecks.

## What I built

I designed and deployed **telemetry dashboards** that collect **anonymous usage data** across each tool in the suite. The system tracks adoption metrics (who's using which tools, how often, for how long), feature engagement (which capabilities get used and which get ignored), workflow patterns (where users stall or abandon multi-step processes), and adoption trends over time.

All telemetry is **anonymous by design**. The system collects behavioral patterns without identifying individual users. Staff can feel comfortable knowing their individual usage isn't being watched, leadership gets the aggregate insights they need for resource allocation, and the data can be shared openly in working groups without privacy concerns.

## What it changed

Telemetry data directly informed which features to improve, simplify, or retire. Leadership could see which tools were delivering value and which needed more training or redesign. Declining usage patterns surfaced early, before they became entrenched, which meant I could intervene while habits were still forming. And comparing patterns across the suite showed which design approaches actually produced engagement.
