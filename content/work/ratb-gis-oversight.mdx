## Context

The **Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB)** was a federal entity charged with overseeing the $840 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Its mission: prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in Recovery Act spending.

I joined as a data analyst with a GIS specialization. The question was straightforward: how do you identify where risk is concentrated across thousands of funded projects spread across the country?

## How GIS changed the investigation workflow

Before geospatial analysis, investigators relied primarily on tips, audits, and financial anomaly detection. Adding a spatial dimension opened new lines of inquiry:

- **Geographic clustering of anomalies**: mapping expenditure patterns revealed regions where spending didn't match expected activity — concentrations that weren't visible in tabular data.
- **Cross-referencing location data**: overlaying recipient addresses, project sites, and subcontractor locations helped identify potential misrepresentation (e.g., projects claiming activity in locations with no evidence of work).
- **Visual communication**: maps made complex investigative findings accessible to audiences ranging from federal investigators to congressional staff to international delegations.

## Leading GIS integration of government data

I led the integration of geospatial data across multiple government systems, building the spatial infrastructure that made location-based investigation possible. This meant standardizing disparate address formats, geocoding recipient and contractor records, and creating overlay datasets that linked financial flows to physical locations across the country.

## Network and lead analysis with Palantir

I used **Palantir** for network and lead analysis — tracing entity relationships across financial and organizational datasets to surface connections that weren't visible in any single data source. This involved mapping relationships between contractors, subcontractors, and recipients to identify suspicious patterns of coordination or misrepresentation.

## Assisting in the creation of a data ontology

I assisted in the creation of a **data ontology** that structured how entities (contractors, awards, locations, transactions) were classified and related across the Board's analytical systems. This shared framework made it possible to connect GIS findings with Palantir link analysis, creating a unified investigative picture from previously siloed datasets.

## The investigation that uncovered 90 contract misrepresentations

I conceived and led an investigation that combined geospatial analysis with network intelligence to **identify 90 contract misrepresentations** — cases where contractors made false claims about project locations, capabilities, or compliance. By layering spatial anomalies over entity relationship patterns, I was able to surface a systematic pattern of fraud that manual review alone had missed.

This was the kind of insight that only emerges when you combine multiple analytical disciplines: geography reveals *where* the anomalies are, network analysis reveals *who* is connected, and a structured ontology connects the dots.

## Communication to diverse stakeholders

One of the most valuable aspects of this role was learning to present analytical findings to vastly different audiences:

- **Internal investigators** needed detailed spatial evidence they could act on
- **Government leadership** needed summary views showing portfolio-level risk patterns
- **International delegations** visited to understand how the U.S. was handling Recovery Act oversight — presentations needed to be accessible and context-rich without exposing sensitive details

This experience shaped my conviction that analytics is only as valuable as the decisions it informs — and that requires meeting each audience where they are.

## What I took forward

This was my first role working with data at mission-critical stakes. The lessons have stayed with me:
- **Data quality is non-negotiable** when your analysis supports investigations
- **Visualization isn't decoration** — it's a tool for making complex patterns intelligible
- **Cross-functional communication** is a core analytical skill, not a nice-to-have
- **The best investigations are conceived, not stumbled into** — the 90-misrepresentation finding came from deliberately designing an analytical approach, not from waiting for a tip
