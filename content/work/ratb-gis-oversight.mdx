## Context

The **Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB)** was a federal entity charged with overseeing the $840 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Its mission: prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in Recovery Act spending.

I joined as a data analyst with a GIS specialization. The question was straightforward: how do you identify where risk is concentrated across thousands of funded projects spread across the country?

## How GIS changed the investigation workflow

Before geospatial analysis, investigators relied primarily on tips, audits, and financial anomaly detection. Adding a spatial dimension opened new lines of inquiry:

- **Geographic clustering of anomalies**: mapping expenditure patterns revealed regions where spending didn't match expected activity — concentrations that weren't visible in tabular data.
- **Cross-referencing location data**: overlaying recipient addresses, project sites, and subcontractor locations helped identify potential misrepresentation (e.g., projects claiming activity in locations with no evidence of work).
- **Visual communication**: maps made complex investigative findings accessible to audiences ranging from federal investigators to congressional staff to international delegations.

## Tools and approach

- **ESRI (ArcGIS)**: primary platform for spatial analysis, map production, and geographic data management
- **Palantir**: used for entity resolution and link analysis across financial and organizational datasets
- **Custom datasets**: built and maintained geospatial datasets that linked financial records to physical locations

The work required careful attention to data quality — address standardization, geocoding accuracy, and handling of incomplete or inconsistent records across multiple reporting systems.

## Communication to diverse stakeholders

One of the most valuable aspects of this role was learning to present analytical findings to vastly different audiences:

- **Internal investigators** needed detailed spatial evidence they could act on
- **Government leadership** needed summary views showing portfolio-level risk patterns
- **International delegations** visited to understand how the U.S. was handling Recovery Act oversight — presentations needed to be accessible and context-rich without exposing sensitive details

This experience shaped my conviction that analytics is only as valuable as the decisions it informs — and that requires meeting each audience where they are.

## What I took forward

This was my first role working with data at mission-critical stakes. The lessons have stayed with me:
- **Data quality is non-negotiable** when your analysis supports investigations
- **Visualization isn't decoration** — it's a tool for making complex patterns intelligible
- **Cross-functional communication** is a core analytical skill, not a nice-to-have
