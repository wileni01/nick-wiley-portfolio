executiveSummary: "Integrated public and internal data to map researcher funding trajectories — revealing co-funders, international funding sources, and career-stage patterns before, during, and after agency funding."
builderSummary: "Built a lineage dashboard incorporating public data with internal records to trace researchers' principal funding sources and identify large co-funders and international funders."

## The decision it supported

Program leadership needed to understand the full arc of researcher engagement: who had been funded before, how researchers collaborated across awards, and what patterns emerged across funding portfolios. But the picture was incomplete when viewed through internal data alone.

Without visibility into researchers' broader funding landscape — including other federal agencies, international sources, and industry partnerships — portfolio reviews relied on institutional memory and manual lookups, limiting the depth of strategic analysis.

## What "lineage" meant

In this context, "lineage" referred to the connected history of a researcher's relationship with the funding ecosystem — not just the agency itself:

- **Funding trajectories**: where were researchers' principal places of funding *before*, *during*, and *after* agency awards?
- **Co-funder identification**: which organizations — federal, state, industry, and international — were co-funding the same researchers, and at what scale?
- **International funding sources**: which foreign governments and international bodies were providing significant research funding to the same investigators?
- **Collaboration networks**: co-PI relationships and cross-disciplinary connections across awards
- **Impact indicators**: publications, outcomes, and downstream effects tied to funded work

The challenge was integrating these signals from **both public and internal data sources** — each with different schemas, update frequencies, and quality characteristics — into a coherent view.

## Incorporating public data with internal records

A key innovation was blending the agency's internal award data with **publicly available research funding databases** to construct a more complete picture of each researcher's funding portfolio. This meant:

- Ingesting and normalizing public grant data from external sources
- Resolving entity matching challenges (researchers publish under different name variations, change institutions, hold multiple affiliations)
- Building derived metrics that compared agency funding to a researcher's total funding landscape
- Identifying **large co-funders** whose investment patterns aligned with — or diverged from — the agency's own portfolio priorities
- Flagging **international funders** to support strategic awareness of global research investment patterns

This public-private data integration turned the dashboard from a retrospective record into a **strategic intelligence tool**.

## Balancing stakeholder needs and data quality

Different stakeholders wanted different things:
- **Executives** wanted high-level summaries: portfolio composition, major co-funders, trends over time, and international funding patterns.
- **Program officers** wanted drill-down capability: individual researcher histories, specific award details, collaboration maps, and before/during/after funding trajectories.
- **Data quality teams** needed transparency about gaps, caveats, and known issues — especially around public data completeness.

Balancing these needs required:
- Layered dashboard design (summary → detail → source)
- Clear labeling of data freshness and known limitations
- Regular stakeholder check-ins to validate that the tool matched how people actually worked

## Technical approach

- **BigQuery** served as the analytical layer, joining internal award data with public funding records
- **SQL-based transformations** standardized naming conventions, resolved entity matching challenges, and built derived metrics including co-funder rankings and international funding breakdowns
- **Tableau dashboards** presented the lineage view with interactive filtering and drill-down across funding stages
- **Python scripts** handled public data ingestion, entity resolution, data quality checks, and automated refresh monitoring

## Outcomes

- **Strategic portfolio intelligence**: leadership could see not just their own investments, but how they fit into researchers' broader funding ecosystems.
- **Co-funder visibility**: identified major co-funding organizations, enabling more informed partnership and coordination discussions.
- **International awareness**: surfaced international funding patterns that informed strategic planning.
- **Faster portfolio reviews**: pre-built views replaced manual data gathering, shortening preparation time.
- **Foundation for future work**: the lineage data model proved useful for subsequent analytical projects.
