## The decision it supported

Program leadership needed to understand the full arc of researcher engagement: who had been funded before, how researchers collaborated across awards, and what patterns emerged across funding portfolios.

Without this visibility, portfolio reviews relied on institutional memory and manual lookups — limiting the depth of analysis and making it difficult to spot trends or gaps.

## What "lineage" meant

In this context, "lineage" referred to the connected history of a researcher's relationship with the agency:
- **Funding history**: prior awards, renewal patterns, and funding trajectories
- **Collaboration networks**: co-PI relationships and cross-disciplinary connections
- **Impact indicators**: publications, outcomes, and downstream effects tied to funded work

The challenge was integrating these signals from multiple data sources — each with different schemas, update frequencies, and quality characteristics — into a coherent view.

## Balancing stakeholder needs and data quality

Different stakeholders wanted different things:
- **Executives** wanted high-level summaries: portfolio composition, trends over time, notable clusters of activity.
- **Program officers** wanted drill-down capability: individual researcher histories, specific award details, collaboration maps.
- **Data quality teams** needed transparency about gaps, caveats, and known issues.

Balancing these needs required:
- Layered dashboard design (summary → detail → source)
- Clear labeling of data freshness and known limitations
- Regular stakeholder check-ins to validate that the tool matched how people actually worked

## Technical approach

- **BigQuery** served as the analytical layer, joining data from multiple operational systems
- **SQL-based transformations** standardized naming conventions, resolved entity matching challenges, and built derived metrics
- **Tableau dashboards** presented the lineage view with interactive filtering and drill-down
- **Python scripts** handled data quality checks and automated refresh monitoring

## Outcomes

- **Better executive reporting**: leadership could review portfolio-level trends without requesting custom analyses.
- **Shared understanding**: a common data layer reduced disagreements about "what the numbers mean."
- **Faster portfolio reviews**: pre-built views replaced manual data gathering, shortening preparation time.
- **Foundation for future work**: the lineage data model proved useful for subsequent analytical projects.
