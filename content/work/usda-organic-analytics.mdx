## Scope and stakeholders

The USDA's organic program oversees more than **50,000 certified organic operations** across the United States. Program leadership needed reliable, timely reporting to support operational decisions, congressional inquiries, and public transparency — but existing reporting was fragmented across multiple systems and manual processes.

Stakeholders ranged from program analysts running daily reports to senior leadership preparing briefings. The platform needed to serve both audiences without requiring each to build their own queries.

## Global data warehouse architecture

### AWS-hosted data warehouse

The analytics platform was built as a **global data warehouse on AWS**, consolidating data from multiple previously siloed systems into a single governed source of truth. The warehouse contained data described as **5+ billion records**, with ETL pipelines processing **millions of records daily**.

What made this warehouse unique was the breadth of systems it integrated:

- **Salesforce**: operational CRM data tracking certifier interactions, compliance workflows, and program communications
- **Integrity Database**: the program's core investigative and enforcement records
- **CBP customs import records**: cross-referencing organic import claims with U.S. Customs and Border Protection data to identify discrepancies between what was claimed as organic and what actually crossed the border
- **Investigative software**: connecting enforcement case data with operational records for end-to-end compliance visibility

Key design decisions:
- **Incremental ETL** to keep processing times manageable at scale
- **Slowly changing dimensions** to preserve historical context for trend analysis
- **Clear data lineage** so analysts could trace any number back to its source system
- **Cross-system entity resolution** to match records across Salesforce, CBP, and internal databases

### NLP for organic import taxonomy

I built a **natural language processing classifier using scikit-learn** to automatically categorize organic import records into the program's taxonomy. Import descriptions arrive in inconsistent, free-text formats — different languages, abbreviations, and trade terminology. The NLP pipeline standardized this unstructured text into the program's official product categories, enabling accurate reporting on import volumes by product type and origin country.

This was a practical ML application: not flashy, but essential for making the warehouse's import data analytically useful at scale.

### Tableau reporting suite

The reporting layer comprised **dozens of Tableau reports**, organized by program area and audience:
- Operational dashboards for day-to-day monitoring
- Executive summaries for leadership briefings
- Ad-hoc exploration views for analysts
- Public-facing reports supporting transparency requirements
- Import analysis views connecting CBP data with certification records

## Governance and accessibility

### Section 508 compliance

All reports were built with **Section 508 / WCAG accessibility** as a first-class requirement — not an afterthought. This included:
- Meaningful alt text and data table alternatives
- Color palettes tested for contrast compliance
- Keyboard-navigable interfaces
- Screen-reader-compatible layouts where Tableau's platform allowed

### Data governance

- Defined data dictionaries and metric definitions so stakeholders shared a common vocabulary
- Established review and approval workflows for new reports
- Documented known data quality issues transparently rather than hiding them

## Operational adoption

Building reports is straightforward. Getting people to use them — and trust them — is harder. Adoption work included:
- **Training sessions** tailored to different skill levels
- **Office hours** for analysts encountering edge cases
- **Change communications** so stakeholders understood what was new and why
- Gradual retirement of legacy reports to reduce confusion

## Outcomes

- **Improved visibility**: leadership gained consistent, timely access to program performance data across all integrated systems.
- **Cross-system intelligence**: connecting Salesforce, CBP customs records, and investigative data enabled compliance insights that no single system could provide alone.
- **Automated classification**: NLP-powered taxonomy reduced manual categorization effort for organic import records.
- **Streamlined reporting**: consolidated dozens of ad-hoc processes into a governed, repeatable reporting suite.
- **Auditable**: every number could be traced back to source systems and transformation logic.
- **Reduced analyst burden**: self-service dashboards allowed analysts to answer routine questions without custom queries.
