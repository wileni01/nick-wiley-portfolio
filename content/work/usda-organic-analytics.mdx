## Scope and stakeholders

The USDA's organic program oversees more than **50,000 certified organic operations** across the United States. Program leadership needed reliable, timely reporting to support operational decisions, congressional inquiries, and public transparency — but existing reporting was fragmented across multiple systems and manual processes.

Stakeholders ranged from program analysts running daily reports to senior leadership preparing briefings. The platform needed to serve both audiences without requiring each to build their own queries.

## Warehouse and reporting architecture

### Data warehouse

The analytics platform was built on a structured data warehouse containing data described as **5+ billion records**, with ETL pipelines processing **millions of records daily**. The warehouse consolidated data from multiple operational systems into a single, governed source of truth.

Key design decisions:
- **Incremental ETL** to keep processing times manageable at scale
- **Slowly changing dimensions** to preserve historical context for trend analysis
- **Clear data lineage** so analysts could trace any number back to its source system

### Tableau reporting suite

The reporting layer comprised **more than four dozen Tableau reports** (approx. 48+), organized by program area and audience:
- Operational dashboards for day-to-day monitoring
- Executive summaries for leadership briefings
- Ad-hoc exploration views for analysts
- Public-facing reports supporting transparency requirements

## Governance and accessibility

### Section 508 compliance

All reports were built with **Section 508 / WCAG accessibility** as a first-class requirement — not an afterthought. This included:
- Meaningful alt text and data table alternatives
- Color palettes tested for contrast compliance
- Keyboard-navigable interfaces
- Screen-reader-compatible layouts where Tableau's platform allowed

### Data governance

- Defined data dictionaries and metric definitions so stakeholders shared a common vocabulary
- Established review and approval workflows for new reports
- Documented known data quality issues transparently rather than hiding them

## Operational adoption

Building reports is straightforward. Getting people to use them — and trust them — is harder. Adoption work included:
- **Training sessions** tailored to different skill levels
- **Office hours** for analysts encountering edge cases
- **Change communications** so stakeholders understood what was new and why
- Gradual retirement of legacy reports to reduce confusion

## Outcomes

- **Improved visibility**: leadership gained consistent, timely access to program performance data.
- **Streamlined reporting**: consolidated dozens of ad-hoc processes into a governed, repeatable reporting suite.
- **Auditable**: every number could be traced back to source systems and transformation logic.
- **Reduced analyst burden**: self-service dashboards allowed analysts to answer routine questions without custom queries.
