## Why adoption is a delivery problem

In consulting, there's a pattern: a team builds something useful, hands it over, and moves on. Six months later, nobody's using it.

Adoption isn't an afterthought. It's a delivery requirement. If the people who need a tool can't use it confidently, the tool doesn't work, no matter how well it's built.

I've seen this enough times to treat enablement as a first-class workstream, running alongside development rather than tacked on at the end.

## How I ran the sessions

### Tableau Study Hall

A recurring, informal session open to anyone in the directorate who worked with data. The format was deliberately low-pressure: no grades, no prerequisites, anyone welcome from first-time users to experienced analysts. Participants brought their actual dashboards and datasets, not toy examples. And the best moments were peer-to-peer: one analyst helping another solve a problem I hadn't anticipated.

Sessions covered fundamentals (connecting to data, building calculations, formatting for accessibility) and advanced topics (LOD expressions, performance optimization, publishing best practices).

### Google BigQuery Study Hall

As the team's data infrastructure moved toward BigQuery, a parallel study hall helped analysts build SQL fluency. That meant writing queries against production datasets with appropriate access controls, understanding how BigQuery's architecture differs from traditional databases, and building reusable query templates for common reporting needs.

### ENG Data Working Group

A more structured forum bringing together analysts, program officers, and leadership to align on data strategy. The group established shared vocabulary by agreeing on metric definitions and data standards, set priorities for which reports and datasets to invest in next, and surfaced data quality problems for collective resolution.

## What changed

Analysts who previously waited for custom reports started building their own dashboards. Knowledge spread beyond the consulting team, making the organization less dependent on us, which is the goal. Regular sessions also created a community of practice that outlasted any single project. And study hall conversations consistently surfaced unmet needs that informed the next round of development.

## What I learned

Enablement doesn't require fancy tooling or elaborate curricula. It requires consistency, patience, and a willingness to meet people where they are. The hardest part isn't teaching SQL. It's convincing a busy program officer that spending an hour learning a tool will save them ten hours next quarter.
