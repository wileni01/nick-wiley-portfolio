## Why adoption is a delivery problem

In consulting, there's a pattern: a team builds something useful, hands it over, and moves on. Six months later, nobody's using it.

Adoption isn't an afterthought — it's a delivery requirement. If the people who need a tool can't use it confidently, the tool doesn't work, no matter how well it's built.

I've seen this enough times to treat enablement as a first-class workstream, running alongside development rather than tacked on at the end.

## How I ran the sessions

### Tableau Study Hall

A recurring, informal session open to anyone in the directorate who worked with data. The format was deliberately low-pressure:
- **No grades, no prerequisites.** Anyone could attend, from first-time users to experienced analysts.
- **Real problems, not toy examples.** Participants brought their actual dashboards and datasets.
- **Peer learning.** I facilitated, but the best moments were when one analyst helped another solve a problem I hadn't anticipated.

Sessions covered fundamentals (connecting to data, building calculations, formatting for accessibility) and advanced topics (LOD expressions, performance optimization, publishing best practices).

### Google BigQuery Study Hall

As the team's data infrastructure moved toward BigQuery, a parallel study hall helped analysts build SQL fluency:
- Writing queries against production datasets (with appropriate access controls)
- Understanding how BigQuery's architecture differs from traditional databases
- Building reusable query templates for common reporting needs

### ENG Data Working Group

A more structured forum bringing together analysts, program officers, and leadership to align on data strategy:
- **Shared vocabulary**: agreeing on metric definitions and data standards
- **Priority setting**: deciding which reports and datasets to invest in next
- **Issue resolution**: surfacing and addressing data quality problems collectively

## Outcomes

- **Increased self-service**: analysts who previously waited for custom reports began building their own dashboards.
- **Reduced "single point of failure"**: knowledge spread beyond the consulting team, making the organization more resilient.
- **Stronger data culture**: regular engagement created a community of practice that persisted beyond any single project.
- **Better requirements**: study hall conversations often surfaced unmet needs that informed the next round of development.

## What I learned

Enablement doesn't require fancy tooling or elaborate curricula. It requires consistency, patience, and a genuine willingness to meet people where they are. The hardest part isn't teaching SQL — it's convincing a busy program officer that spending an hour learning a tool will save them ten hours next quarter.
