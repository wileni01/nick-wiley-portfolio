## The problem

Operational data across the program needed to meet specific compliance requirements — but checking compliance was a manual, ad-hoc process. Staff would run queries, compare results to standards, and report findings — a process that was inconsistent, time-consuming, and rarely comprehensive. With no systematic approach, compliance gaps could go undetected until they surfaced in audits or operational failures.

## What I built

**ADCC** (Automated Data Compliance Checker) is a tool with live data connections that allows users to perform **28 distinct compliance checks** on the status of operational data. Each check is:

- **Clearly defined**: what it checks, what constitutes a pass or fail, and what the remediation path looks like
- **Automated**: runs against live data with no manual query writing required
- **Repeatable**: can be executed on a schedule or on-demand, producing consistent results every time
- **Documented**: results are logged for audit trail purposes

The checks cover a range of data quality and compliance dimensions — completeness, timeliness, consistency, referential integrity, and business rule adherence.

## Design approach

Rather than building a monolithic compliance report, I designed ADCC as a **modular rules engine** where each check is independently defined and can be:
- Run individually or as a full suite
- Configured with different thresholds for different data domains
- Extended with new checks as compliance requirements evolve

The tool provides a user-facing interface where staff can:
- Select which checks to run
- View results with clear pass/fail indicators
- Drill into specific records that triggered failures
- Export findings for remediation tracking

## Impact

- **Replaced manual auditing** with systematic, automated compliance validation
- **28 checks running consistently** — far more comprehensive than any manual spot-check approach could achieve
- **Early detection**: issues surfaced proactively rather than discovered during formal audits
- **Staff empowerment**: users can check compliance themselves without writing queries or depending on analysts
