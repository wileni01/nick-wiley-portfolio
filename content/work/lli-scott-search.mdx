## The problem

The Lincoln Leadership Institute's HubSpot CRM had accumulated years of contacts — from event registrations, email campaigns, manual entry, and partner imports. Over time, a significant portion had gone stale: bounced emails, unsubscribed contacts, people who changed jobs or companies. These weren't bad leads — they were *lost* leads. Many had attended flagship programs, held senior titles, and represented exactly the kind of relationship worth recovering.

But recovering stale contacts is tedious. Someone has to look at each one, compare old data against current information, decide whether the enriched data looks right, and approve the update. Without a tool that makes this process fast and even enjoyable, it doesn't get done.

## What I built

Scott Search is a **human-in-the-loop decision-support tool** that transforms contact recovery from a dreaded chore into an engaging, gamified workflow. The system has four layers:

### 1. Staleness scoring

The pipeline starts by calculating a staleness score for every contact in HubSpot:

- **Days since last engagement** (weighted 2x — the strongest signal)
- **Email bounce status** (+100 points — hard evidence of a stale address)
- **Unsubscribe status** (+50 points)
- **No recent activity** (+30 points)

Contacts scoring 100+ enter the recovery pipeline. This ensures the tool focuses on contacts that actually need attention, not the entire CRM.

### 2. Apollo.io enrichment

Each stale contact is matched against Apollo.io's People Match API. The system calculates match confidence from multiple signals:

- **Name similarity** (Levenshtein distance matching, 40 points)
- **Company match** (25 points)
- **LinkedIn URL found** (15 points)
- **Email domain match** (10 points)
- **New email found** (5 points)

A minimum 50% confidence threshold filters out unreliable matches. What comes back: current LinkedIn profiles, updated email addresses, new job titles, company changes — the data needed to reconnect with a lost contact.

### 3. Lead scoring (rule-based + GPT-4)

Not all recovered contacts are worth the same effort. A two-tier scoring system prioritizes the queue:

**Rule-based scoring** (always runs):
- Title seniority (C-level: 30pts, VP: 25pts, Director: 20pts)
- Company size (Enterprise: 25pts, Large: 20pts)
- Previous engagement history (meetings: 25pts, emails: 15pts)
- LinkedIn found: 10pts
- Match confidence factor: 0-10pts

**GPT-4 enhanced scoring** (optional, for high-potential contacts):
- Triggers when rule-based score is 50+
- Provides reasoning alongside the score
- Blended result: 60% rule-based + 40% LLM

### 4. The review UI — where gamification meets decision support

This is the core of Scott Search. Instead of a spreadsheet or a CRM bulk-edit screen, reviewers work through a **card-based interface** with side-by-side comparison of old vs. enriched data.

What makes it work:

- **Keyboard shortcuts**: A = Approve, R = Reject, S = Skip, Ctrl+Z = Undo. Fast enough that reviewing a contact takes seconds, not minutes.
- **XP and levels**: Approve = 15 XP, Reject = 10 XP, Skip = 5 XP. 100 XP per level. It's a small thing, but it changes the psychological framing from "I have 500 contacts to review" to "I'm 40 XP from the next level."
- **Streaks**: Consecutive reviews build a streak counter (with fire animation). Breaks after 5 minutes of inactivity. This encourages flow state.
- **Achievements**: "First Contact," "Centurion" (100 reviews), "Machine Mode" (25 streak), and more. Unlocks trigger confetti animations and sound effects via the Web Audio API.
- **Confidence indicators**: Color-coded match confidence and lead scores make it immediately clear which contacts are high-value vs. marginal.
- **Full undo support**: Every action (approve, reject, skip) is reversible with a complete action history.

## Technical architecture

```
HubSpot Contact List
    ↓
Lost Contact Finder (staleness scoring)
    ↓
Apollo.io Enrichment (LinkedIn, email, company)
    ↓
Lead Scoring (rule-based + optional GPT-4)
    ↓
Review Queue (SQLite or Turso)
    ↓
Scott Search Web UI (human review)
    ↓
HubSpot Sync (approved contacts only)
```

### Stack decisions

- **Flask** for the web UI — lightweight enough for a focused tool, with Jinja2 templates for server-rendered pages
- **SQLite** for local development, **Turso/libSQL** for cloud deployment — serverless-compatible with no native dependencies
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for the frontend — no framework overhead for what's essentially a single-screen review tool. Web Audio API for sounds, Canvas API for confetti.
- **Vercel** deployment via a serverless adapter (`api/index.py`)

### HubSpot integration

Approved contacts sync back to HubSpot with custom properties:
- `scott_search_approved`: timestamp for tracking
- `scott_linkedin_invite_sent`: outreach tracking
- `old_email_address`: preserves the previous email before updating
- LinkedIn URLs update the `linkedinbio` property
- Secondary emails go to `hs_additional_emails`

## Design philosophy

The gamification isn't decoration — it solves a real adoption problem. Contact data cleanup is genuinely boring work. Most CRM hygiene initiatives die because nobody wants to sit through hundreds of records. By reframing review as a game with progression, streaks, and achievements, the tool creates intrinsic motivation to keep going.

The dark-themed UI (slate background, color-coded actions) reduces eye strain during long sessions. Keyboard shortcuts mean reviewers never have to reach for the mouse. Toast notifications and XP popups provide constant feedback without interrupting the flow.

## Outcomes

- Recovered hundreds of stale contacts with updated LinkedIn profiles and email addresses
- Gamification drove sustained engagement — reviewers voluntarily extended sessions to reach the next level or maintain their streak
- Human-in-the-loop design ensured every CRM update was intentionally approved, preventing data quality regressions
- The tool created a repeatable process for periodic contact hygiene, not just a one-time cleanup
