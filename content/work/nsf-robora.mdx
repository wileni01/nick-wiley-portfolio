executiveSummary: "Replaced a fragile Excel-based document workflow with an automated pipeline: data queries, template population, and Chrome browser automation to post into a legacy system with no API."
builderSummary: "Python pipeline: queries large datasets, populates document templates, then uses Chrome automation to post results into a legacy web interface."

## The situation

Program staff relied on a manual, Excel-based process to generate recurring operational documents. Each document required pulling data from multiple sources, manually copying values into spreadsheet templates, and then re-entering everything into an internal system. The process was slow, error-prone, and entirely dependent on institutional knowledge of which cells mapped to which data sources. As document volumes grew, the manual approach became a bottleneck and a risk, since copy-paste errors in operational documents have downstream consequences.

## What I built

**RoboRA** replaced the Excel workflow with an automated pipeline. It queries large datasets programmatically to retrieve the values needed for each document, populates templates using a structured mapping between data fields and template positions, handles edge cases (missing data, format variations, conditional sections) that the manual process handled inconsistently, and produces audit-ready output with clear traceability from source data to final document.

The harder part was the legacy system. The internal application where documents needed to be posted had no API, only a web interface designed for manual data entry. Rather than waiting for a system modernization that might never come, I wrote **Chrome browser automation** that crawls the legacy web interface, navigates to the correct posting locations, enters document data into form fields, and validates successful submission. A pragmatic solution that bridged a modern data pipeline and a legacy system without asking anyone to change their infrastructure.

## What it changed

Document generation that used to take hours of copy-paste work now runs automatically. Programmatic template population eliminated the transcription errors that came with the Excel process. Browser automation provided integration where no API existed. And the system scales: growing document volumes don't require proportional increases in manual effort.
