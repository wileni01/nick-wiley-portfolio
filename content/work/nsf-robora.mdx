## The problem

Program staff relied on a manual, Excel-based process to generate recurring operational documents. Each document required pulling data from multiple sources, manually copying values into spreadsheet templates, and then re-entering the results into an internal system. The process was slow, error-prone, and entirely dependent on institutional knowledge of which cells mapped to which data sources.

As document volumes grew, the manual approach became a bottleneck — and a risk, since copy-paste errors in operational documents can have downstream consequences.

## What I built

### Automated document generation

**RoboRA** replaced the Excel-based workflow with an automated pipeline that:
- **Queries large datasets** programmatically to retrieve the values needed for each document
- **Populates document templates** using a structured mapping between data fields and template positions
- **Handles edge cases** — missing data, format variations, conditional sections — that the manual process handled inconsistently
- **Produces audit-ready output** with clear traceability from source data to final document

### Chrome browser automation for legacy system integration

The internal system where documents needed to be posted had no API — only a web interface designed for manual data entry. Rather than waiting for a system modernization that might never come, I wrote **Chrome browser automation** that:
- Crawls the legacy web interface
- Navigates to the correct posting locations
- Automatically enters document data into form fields
- Validates successful submission

This pragmatic approach bridged the gap between a modern data pipeline and a legacy system, eliminating the most tedious and error-prone step in the workflow.

## Impact

- **Eliminated manual data entry**: document generation that previously required hours of copy-paste work now runs automatically
- **Reduced errors**: programmatic template population removes the human transcription errors that plagued the Excel-based process
- **Bridged legacy systems**: browser automation provided integration where no API existed, without requiring infrastructure changes
- **Scalable**: the system handles growing document volumes without proportional increases in manual effort
