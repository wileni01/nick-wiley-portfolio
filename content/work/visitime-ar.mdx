## What VisiTime was

VisiTime was an augmented reality company I founded to make historical and cultural sites more accessible through technology. The core idea: use geospatial data to anchor contextual stories to physical locations, then deliver those stories through mobile apps and interactive tour devices.

The flagship product was a **six-hour interactive iPad tour system** built for Gettysburg's 150th anniversary context — a guided experience that combined maps, imagery, narration, and location-aware content to help visitors understand a complex landscape.

## What I built

I touched every layer of the stack — from platform programming to content conversion to field operations:

- **Unity platform programming**: Built the augmented reality experience on the Unity engine, developing the core interaction layer that rendered historical overlays onto real-world camera views
- **AR mobile applications** for iOS and Android that overlaid historical context onto real-world views
- **An interactive iPad tour system** — a self-contained guided experience designed for rental to visitors
- **A geospatial content pipeline** that transformed historical data, maps, and media into location-anchored narratives
- **A tour book** combining printed and digital elements

## Technical depth

### Troubleshooting proprietary AR software with sensor data
I diagnosed and resolved issues in proprietary augmented reality software by analyzing raw sensor data — GPS accuracy, accelerometer drift, compass calibration — to understand why AR overlays weren't aligning correctly in field conditions. Gettysburg's terrain (hills, tree cover, metal monuments) created real challenges for sensor accuracy that couldn't be solved in the lab.

### Converting rich historical content for location-based delivery
I adapted hours of rich historical content — maps, imagery, narratives, primary sources — into formats that could be dynamically triggered based on a visitor's physical location. This meant rethinking how stories were structured: not as linear narratives, but as modular experiences keyed to geographic coordinates.

### Coordinating the conversion of map data into machine-readable formats
Historical maps don't come in GIS-ready formats. I coordinated the conversion of archival map data into machine-readable geospatial layers, working with cartographic sources that predated digital mapping by over a century.

### Painstaking geocoding of historical content
I personally geocoded historical content for dynamic delivery based on location intelligence — placing narrative waypoints, image triggers, and audio cues at precise coordinates across the Gettysburg battlefield. This wasn't bulk geocoding; it was meticulous, point-by-point work that required deep knowledge of both the historical landscape and the technical tolerances of GPS-based content delivery.

## Business execution

- **Raised $200K+** through grants, competitions, and partnerships to fund product development
- **Iterated a scalable rental model** — testing pricing, logistics, and operations for a physical/digital product hybrid
- **Managed a rental fleet of iPads** including device imaging, provisioning, field maintenance, and logistics for daily visitor use
- Reported **400% annual growth** in one operating period (reported figure; treat as approximate)
- Managed a distributed team across content creation, app development, and field operations

## Evangelizing in a technology-resistant market

I gave presentations to the **Civil War historical society** and related audiences — communities deeply passionate about authenticity and often skeptical of technology in historical spaces. Gettysburg is a market where technology adoption requires building trust first. I learned to position AR not as a replacement for traditional interpretation, but as a way to make the landscape itself tell its story. Convincing historians and preservationists that augmented reality could *serve* their mission rather than dilute it was one of the most challenging and rewarding aspects of the venture.

## Patents

I hold two U.S. **utility patents** related to the technology:
- **US Patent 9,417,668**
- **US Patent 9,900,042**

These patents cover methods for location-aware content delivery in augmented reality tour experiences.

## Founder lessons

Starting and running VisiTime taught me things consulting never could:

### Focus is survival
When resources are thin, every feature decision is a bet. I learned to prioritize ruthlessly — building the minimum product that served the core use case and deferring everything else.

### Sales reality
Having a great product doesn't matter if you can't explain why someone should pay for it. I spent as much time on positioning, partnerships, and field testing as I did on engineering.

### Operations matter
Renting iPads to tourists in a national park means dealing with logistics, weather, breakage, and customer support. These operational challenges were as demanding as the technical ones — and just as important to get right.

### Knowing when to move on
I wound VisiTime down around 2020. Not every startup succeeds in the market, but the skills I built — product thinking, fundraising, cross-functional delivery, and the ability to make hard tradeoff decisions — are ones I apply every day in my current work.
