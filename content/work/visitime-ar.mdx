## What VisiTime was

VisiTime was an augmented reality company I founded to make historical and cultural sites more accessible through technology. The core idea: use geospatial data to anchor contextual stories to physical locations, then deliver those stories through mobile apps and interactive tour devices.

The flagship product was a **six-hour interactive iPad tour system** built for Gettysburg's 150th anniversary context — a guided experience that combined maps, imagery, narration, and location-aware content to help visitors understand a complex landscape.

## What I built

- **AR mobile applications** for iOS and Android that overlaid historical context onto real-world views
- **An interactive iPad tour system** — a self-contained guided experience designed for rental to visitors
- **A geospatial content pipeline** that transformed historical data, maps, and media into location-anchored narratives
- **A tour book** combining printed and digital elements

## Business execution

- **Raised $200K+** through grants, competitions, and partnerships to fund product development
- **Iterated a scalable rental model** — testing pricing, logistics, and operations for a physical/digital product hybrid
- Reported **400% annual growth** in one operating period (reported figure; treat as approximate)
- Managed a distributed team across content creation, app development, and field operations

## Patents

I hold two U.S. patents related to the technology:
- **US Patent 9,417,668**
- **US Patent 9,900,042**

## Founder lessons

Starting and running VisiTime taught me things consulting never could:

### Focus is survival
When resources are thin, every feature decision is a bet. I learned to prioritize ruthlessly — building the minimum product that served the core use case and deferring everything else.

### Sales reality
Having a great product doesn't matter if you can't explain why someone should pay for it. I spent as much time on positioning, partnerships, and field testing as I did on engineering.

### Operations matter
Renting iPads to tourists in a national park means dealing with logistics, weather, breakage, and customer support. These operational challenges were as demanding as the technical ones — and just as important to get right.

### Knowing when to move on
I wound VisiTime down around 2020. Not every startup succeeds in the market, but the skills I built — product thinking, fundraising, cross-functional delivery, and the ability to make hard tradeoff decisions — are ones I apply every day in my current work.
