## What VisiTime was

VisiTime was an augmented reality company I founded to make historical and cultural sites more accessible through technology. The core idea: use geospatial data to anchor contextual stories to physical locations, then deliver those stories through mobile apps and interactive tour devices.

The flagship product was a **six-hour interactive iPad tour system** built for Gettysburg's 150th anniversary, a guided experience combining maps, imagery, narration, and location-aware content to help visitors understand a complex landscape.

## What I built

I touched every layer of the stack. I programmed the core AR experience on the **Unity** engine, developing the interaction layer that rendered historical overlays onto real-world camera views. I built AR mobile applications for iOS and Android, designed the self-contained iPad tour system for rental to visitors, created a geospatial content pipeline that transformed historical data and media into location-anchored narratives, and produced a tour book combining printed and digital elements.

## Technical depth

**Troubleshooting AR with sensor data.** I diagnosed and resolved issues in proprietary augmented reality software by analyzing raw sensor data (GPS accuracy, accelerometer drift, compass calibration) to understand why AR overlays weren't aligning correctly in field conditions. Gettysburg's terrain (hills, tree cover, metal monuments) created real challenges for sensor accuracy that couldn't be solved in the lab.

**Converting content for location-based delivery.** I adapted hours of rich historical content (maps, imagery, narratives, primary sources) into formats that could be dynamically triggered based on a visitor's physical location. That meant rethinking how stories were structured: not as linear narratives, but as modular experiences keyed to geographic coordinates.

**Map data conversion.** Historical maps don't come in GIS-ready formats. I coordinated the conversion of archival map data into machine-readable geospatial layers, working with cartographic sources that predated digital mapping by over a century.

**Painstaking geocoding.** I personally geocoded historical content for dynamic delivery based on location intelligence, placing narrative waypoints, image triggers, and audio cues at precise coordinates across the battlefield. This wasn't bulk geocoding. It was meticulous, point-by-point work requiring deep knowledge of both the historical landscape and the technical tolerances of GPS-based content delivery.

## Business execution

I **raised $200K+** through grants, competitions, and partnerships to fund product development. I iterated on a scalable rental model, testing pricing, logistics, and operations for a physical/digital product hybrid. I managed a rental fleet of iPads including device imaging, provisioning, field maintenance, and daily logistics. We reported **400% annual growth** in one operating period (treat as approximate). And I managed a distributed team across content creation, app development, and field operations.

## Evangelizing in a technology-resistant market

I gave presentations to the **Civil War historical society** and related audiences, communities deeply passionate about authenticity and often skeptical of technology in historical spaces. Gettysburg is a market where trust comes before adoption. I learned to position AR not as a replacement for traditional interpretation, but as a way to make the landscape itself tell its story. Convincing historians and preservationists that augmented reality could serve their mission rather than dilute it was one of the most challenging and rewarding parts of the venture.

## Patents

I hold two U.S. **utility patents** related to the technology: **US Patent 9,417,668** and **US Patent 9,900,042**. They cover methods for location-aware content delivery in augmented reality tour experiences.

## What I learned

When resources are thin, every feature decision is a bet. I learned to prioritize ruthlessly: build the minimum that serves the core use case and defer everything else. Having a good product doesn't matter if you can't explain why someone should pay for it — I spent as much time on positioning, partnerships, and field testing as I did on engineering.

Running a product company also taught me delivery ownership at a level consulting rarely does: I owned the architecture, the roadmap, the stakeholder relationships, the operations, and the revenue. I wound VisiTime down around 2020, but the instincts I built — how to prioritize, how to align technical decisions with business constraints, and when to walk away from a feature — are things I use every day in solution architecture.
