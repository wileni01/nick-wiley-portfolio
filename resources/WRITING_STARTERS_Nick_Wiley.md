# Writing Starters (MDX drafts)

## 1) Human-in-the-loop isn’t a compromise. It’s the point.
The strongest AI systems I’ve worked on don’t “replace” experts—they **make expert judgment easier to apply consistently**.

In high-stakes environments, the product requirement is rarely “maximize model accuracy.” It’s:
- make decisions faster **without losing accountability**
- surface uncertainty
- capture rationale
- keep humans in control

When people hear “human-in-the-loop,” they sometimes think it’s a temporary stage before full automation.

In my experience, it’s the destination.

## 2) From dashboards to decisions: what analytics is for
Dashboards don’t create value. Decisions do.

A useful analytics product starts with a question someone is actually responsible for answering:
- What should we fund?
- Where is risk accumulating?
- What’s changing faster than our process?

Then you build backwards: data → logic → visualization → adoption.

## 3) What consulting taught me about building AI responsibly
In consulting, your model isn’t the deliverable. The deliverable is a system people can trust.

That means:
- documentation
- governance
- stakeholder alignment
- accessibility
- change management
- and a workflow that survives the day after you leave
